# 1. This library is developed on STM32F051R8T6 microcontroller.

This library will be developed also on other architectures like AVR,
PIC or TI MSP430. Stay tuned.

# 2. This library is not using HAL or any other low layer drivers. 

If you see this as problem, just search for another library. 

# 3. API of the library.

This section describes avaliable programming interface. 

##	3.1. How to setup example project
	
First of all, you need to include proper *.h files in your code.

* ks108.h --> this file contains basic API to initialize library.
* internal/ks108_icons.h --> this file contains some icons that can be used by user 
  with KS108_loadSmallBitmap() func.
